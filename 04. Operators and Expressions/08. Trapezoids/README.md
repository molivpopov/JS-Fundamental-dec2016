# Trapezoids

## Description
Implement a javascript function that calculates trapezoid's area by given sides **a** and **b** and height **h**. 
The three values should be read from the console in the order shown below. All three value will be floating-point numbers.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array with exactly **3** numbers as elements: **a**, **b** and **h**, all as strings.

## Output
- Output a single line containing a single value - the area of the trapezoid. Output the area with exactly _7-digit precision_ after the floating point.
- You can use `console.log` to print the results or you can use `return` to return the answer. Both are correct.

## Constraints
- All numbers will always be valid floating-point numbers in the range `[-500, 500]`.
- Time limit: **0.1s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
